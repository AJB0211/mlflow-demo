# mlflow-demo
Demo for using an MLflow server run out of an EC2

After setting up an MLflow server run
`python hello-mlflow.py <uri>`
with the server's uri inserted to put a `hello-world` experiment up on the MLflow server.

A demo is included in `hello_gartner.ipynb` that outlines out to communicate with a `hello-gartner` experiment up on the same MLflow server. Be sure to input the uri into the correct box in the notebook.
